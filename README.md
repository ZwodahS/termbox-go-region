# Overview

A simple wrapper on top of termbox-go to deal with drawing in region.

# Assumptions

There are a lot of assumptions made when I wrote this wrapper.
The main usage for this wrapper is for building terminal games like nethack.

This means that this might not serve your use case.

# Warning

Also, this is not finalized, things will change.
